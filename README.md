# About

Arroba was originally conceived out of boredom, but I realized it has a
lot of potential. It has taught me a lot, haha.

The benefits of Arroba are:

* It's clean
* It's easy
* It's straightforward
* It applies concepts from languages like C# and JavaScript,
in a way that makes sense
* Good async support
* Nice REPL
* Friendly
* Arrows
* Easy on the eyes
* **FUN** to write!

# Tasks allow you to do stuff asynchronously.
# Create a Task by passing a function to the constructor.

# You can add a callback.
task.then(fn(x) {
    print("Asynchronously: " -> cat(x))

# The error will receive a string, the error message.

# They cannot be re-used.

# You can run the task and have it block.
# Just use yield.

# Or, by using await

# You can also pass arguments to await
